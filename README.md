## Overview

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline for generating the Center for Metropolitan Studies ([CEM](https://centrodametropole.fflch.usp.br/)) logo pattern, based on its [20-Year Commemorative Logo](images/logo-cem-20.png).

The report is available [here](https://cem-usp.github.io/logo-pattern/).

## Usage

The pipeline was developed using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system, along with the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. To ensure consistent results, the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package was used to manage and restore the R environment.

After installing the three dependencies mentioned above, follow these steps to reproduce the results:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
3. **Restore the R environment** by running [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) in the R console. This will install all required software dependencies.
4. **Open** `index.qmd` and run the code as described in the report.

## Rendering

After installing all dependencies (see the [Usage](#usage) section), run the following command in the terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will start the rendering process. Once complete, the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) report will be available in the [`docs`](docs) folder.
